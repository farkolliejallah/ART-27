<h1>Re: Albert Momo university applicatiion</h1>
<hr>

<p>Dear Mr. Momo,</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to 
 study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PHD</abbr> next year. I will answer your
questions one by one, in  the following sections.</p>
 
<h2>Starting dates</h2>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit
   us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start date for each one are 
   as follows:</p>
   <p>First semester: 9 October 2022<br>
   Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>
   Third semester:2 May 2023</p>

<p>Please let me know if this is okay, and if which start date you prefer.</p>
university dates on our website.</p>

<h2>Subjects of study</h2>

<p>At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility- as long as the Subjects
fall in the real of scienc and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
just the kind of person we'd have like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted,
we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
<p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>
0<sub>3</sub>)
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30C (86F), when
the audience size exponentially increase ( effect of 3 x 10<sub>3</sub> increasing to 3
x 10<sub>4</sub>.)</p>

<p> HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
So please can you provide more information on each of these subject, including how long you'd expect
the research to take, required staff and other resoureces, and anything else you thing we need to
know? Thinks.</p>

<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my pst-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dance. To
to answer ur question, my favourite dance are as follows, with definations</p>

<p>Polynesian chicken dance
A little known but very  influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village
would dance around in circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "friutful."</p>
<p>Icelandic browian shuffle
Before the Icelander develop fire as a means of getting warm, they use to practice this dance,
which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,  and shuffling their bodies 
around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow used to say that he thought
this dance inspired modern style such as Twerking.</p>
<p>Arctic robot dance
An intresting exmple of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1990s believe to have
discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practice by 
inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were 
just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
